- [Anaconda (Python)](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) **FREE**: This package includes python and many other useful libraries. 
- IDES: Take a look at all of these options. Pick one.
	- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) **FREE** 
	- [Atom](https://atom.io/) **FREE**
	- Python IDLE: This is included with the Anaconda download. NOT recommended.
	- [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) **FREE**

**NOTES:** TensorFlow 2 is now supported on Python 3.7. So instead you will write:
```
conda create -n tensor python=3.7`
